Arnaud Salvador (he/him/his) is a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Berlin, Germany. He uses and develops planetary interior and atmospheric models to characterize the habitability of rocky planets, from the distant past to the near future. He is particularly interested in the evolution of the magma ocean, its outgassing, solidification, and cooling in interaction with the atmosphere and the implications for early water ocean formation on Earth, Venus, and exoplanets. Arnaud also investigates the capabilities of future direct imaging observatories in retrieving atmospheric properties and surface conditions of distant worlds, to refine instruments design and define the most efficient observing strategies.
