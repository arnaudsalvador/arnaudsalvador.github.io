abstract = {Abstract This paper presents an updated version of the simple 1-D radiative-convective H2O-CO2 atmospheric model from Marcq (2012) and used by Lebrun et al. (2013) in their coupled interior-atmosphere model. This updated version includes a correction of a major miscalculation of the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and extends the validity of the model (P coordinate system, possible inclusion of N2, and improved numerical stability). It confirms the qualitative findings of Marcq (2012), namely, (1) the existence of a blanketing effect in any H2O-dominated atmosphere: the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) reaches an asymptotic value, also known as Nakajima's limit and first evidenced by Nakajima et al. (1992), around 280 W/m2 neglecting clouds, significantly higher than our former estimate from Marcq (2012). (2) The blanketing effect breaks down for a given threshold temperature Tϵ, with a fast increase of OLR with increasing surface temperature beyond this threshold, making extrasolar planets in such an early stage of their evolution easily detectable near 4 μm provided they orbit a red dwarf. Tϵ increases strongly with H2O surface pressure, but increasing CO2 pressure leads to a slight decrease of Tϵ. (3) Clouds act both by lowering Nakajima's limit by up to 40\% and by extending the blanketing effect, raising the threshold temperature Tϵ by about 10\%.},
