abstract = {Survey strategies for upcoming exoplanet direct imaging missions have considered varying assumptions of prior knowledge. Precursor radial velocity surveys could have detected nearby exo-Earths and provided prior orbit and mass constraints. Alternatively, a direct imaging mission performing astrometry could yield constraints on the orbit and phase angle of target planets. Understanding the impact of prior mass and orbit information on planetary characterization is crucial for efficiently recognizing habitable exoplanets. To address this question, we use a reflected-light retrieval tool to infer the atmospheric and bulk properties of directly imaged Earth-analogs while considering varying levels of prior information and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Because of the strong correlation between the orbit-related parameters and the planetary radius, prior information on the orbital distance and planetary phase angle yield much tighter constraints on the planetary radius: from  without prior knowledge, to  with prior determination of the orbit for S/N = 20 in the visible/near-infrared spectral range, thus allowing size determination from reflected light observations. However, additional knowledge of planet mass does not notably enhance radius () or atmospheric characterization. Also, prior knowledge of the mass alone does not yield a tight radius constraint () nor improves atmospheric composition inference. By contrast, because of its sensitivity to gas column abundance, detecting a Rayleigh scattering slope or bounding Rayleigh opacity helps to refine gas mixing ratio inferences without requiring prior mass knowledge. Overall, apart from radius determination, increasing the S/N is more beneficial than additional prior observations.}
